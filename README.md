# code-library Angular App

This project is designed to be a one-stop resource for developers to use for information and instructions about any coding topic. 

Each topic is taken from the syllabus to help students further understand each concept. 

It is also designed to be added to when you would like to study additional topics.  
  -- Adding a new topic -- 
  1. Simply add a new html Template to the "Views" folder
  2. Add a new object with name and state to "topicService.js" with the proper path to link in the .state
  3. Open app.js and add a new .state with the proper path from your "topicService.js". 
  4. Your new topic should show up in the side menu.
  5. Copy html from another template view (topic) and paste it into your new htmlTemplate.html in the "Views" folder. (see step 1)
